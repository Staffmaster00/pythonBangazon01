## Instructions:

     Simply run python humansizes.py on the provided python file to see how python uses objects and def

## What I learned:

     1. Everything in Python is an object like Javascript without primitive forms.

     2. The entire module is run as an object in the CLI and given properties called _name_ with
     a value of _main_ unless imported.

     3. print() ~ console.log()

     4. Objects are called dictionaries in Python

     5. Whitespace matters

     6. if and for use colons instead with indentation after
     
     7. Functions work simarily but are called defintions using the def keyword.

     8. Compliler determines values at execution of the code like Javascript
